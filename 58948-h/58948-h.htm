<div><h1>PREFACE.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/dropT.jpg' style='float:left;width:11%;' alt='T'/>here is a custom, hoary with the accumulated dust of
ages, originating many a long century ago, in a certain,
but now extinct “garden,” of which we all know more or
less, viz: That man will and must eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the helplessness of man there has grown another
custom, equally old, (some say even older) that women shall set
before him that which shall satisfy man’s hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day to this women have vied with one another for
pre-eminence in culinary art. Now any man will tell you that in
this art, there has been vouchsafed to some a greater measure of
perfection than to others. With this thought in mind, it has been
the effort of the compilers to gather together and set forth in the
pages of this book the proudest achievements of the best cooks
to be found among the women of Christ Church Parish and others
of the city of Burlington, Iowa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being such a laudable object, it seems to the writer,
that no apology for this book can be necessary. It is, therefore,
put forth with the utmost confidence that it will receive a hearty
welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all things done in haste, it will no doubt, show defects
to the critical eye; but such as it is, we cast it like “bread”
“upon the waters,” trusting that it may return in another form,
ere many days are past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To make four small loaves—Take three tablespoonsful of
flour and scald with two teacups of sour or butter milk,
curd and whey, add a pinch of sugar and salt, when cool
add one cake of yeast. Let it stand in a warm place four

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Roast Sirloin of Beef, Yorkshire Pudding.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sirloin of beef is the outer or upper part of the
loins, covering the kidneys and separated from the tenderloin
by a flat bone. It is known to American housekeepers
as porter house, (the popular steak of the old New York
porter and ale houses, hence <a id='its1'></a>its name). The cut usually
palmed off on New York housekeepers as sirloin is a hip
steak or roast, the proper name of which is a rump-cut,
considered by New England people, to be one of the best
joints. Select the middle cut of the loin of a good-sized
animal, and see to it that the outer fat is at least a quarter
of an inch thick; for if the top covering of fat be thin, and
more like gristle than fat, the meat will be found very tough
and unpalatable. Trim away most of the inner fat and a
part of the flank; and as the tenderloin is more useful as
steaks or an entree, it is best to cut it out; also turn the
flank under, and if skewers are used, insert them in the flank
only. Salt and pepper the whole joint liberally, and dash a
little flour over the outer fat. Put it in a pan large enough
to hold the joint and a pudding, and when the joint is half
done add the pudding. While cooking baste the meat, and
if the pudding is too dry, baste it also. At the end of an
hour and a half, an eight-pound joint, if a good thick one,
will be cooked; but, if a thin joint, a much shorter time is
required.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
To make the Yorkshire pudding: Beat thoroughly 5
eggs, add to them a teaspoonful of salt, a pint of milk and
a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Sift together two teaspoonsful
of baking powder and three half pints of flour. Add the egg
mixture gradually and make a stiff batter. Put it in the
pan, not under, but beside the beef. [A Yorkshire matron
suggests the addition of lemon juice to correct the two frequent
ill-effects of so rich a dish.]</p>

of nutmeg and a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. Add a
little more stock if a liberal quantity of sauce is desired.
Cover the dish and simmer until tender, allowing forty

they are not cooked too much. Remove the pan to the back

<p class='pindent'>The French cooks generally use carbonate of ammonia to
preserve the color of vegetables. What would lay on the point
of a pen knife, is mixed in the water in which the vegetables
(such as peas, spinach, string-beans and asparagus) are
boiled. The ammonia all evaporates in boiling, leaving no
ill effects. They also say that it prevents the odor of boiling
cabbage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1 pound of confectioner’s sugar, 6 tablespoonsful of

drop onto that the oil of peppermint and stir up, adding
the cream tartar. Boil the rest of the sugar with the water
three minutes, or until it forms a thread at the end of a
spoon. Do not stir the syrup. Remove from fire as soon
as done and add the mixture from the cup. Stir briskly
until it turns white and creamy. Drop from a teaspoon
(making rounds any size you wish) onto previously prepared
paper—either waxed paper or what has been rubbed with
sweet oil, or fresh butter, or thick cream. If the candy hardens
too much to drop, put on the fire and stir until it
grows thinner, then drop as before.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
